            "Latest advancements in wind energy technology include technologies that both increase efficiency and adaptability. Enhanced designs, such as vertical-axis wind turbines, are more efficient, quieter, and safer for birds. New materials used in construction make turbines lighter and more robust. Energy storage technologies also show promise in maintaining an uninterrupted power supply during periods of low wind.\n",

Recent developments like perovskite solar cells and multi-junction solar cells offer higher efficiency rates compared to the traditional silicon-based cells. Additionally, the development of transparent solar panels that can turn windows into power producers represents a significant advancement.\n",
